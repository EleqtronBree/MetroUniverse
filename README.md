# MetroUniverse
Project for Metro Universe designed on Roblox Studio

This project was created around June 2018.
This was a train game that was meant to take passenger players to different worlds. The objective was to explore, find rewards and survive any disasters that hit the train. The project was almost finished when only the minigame code was needed to run the game but due to the lack of resources, the project could not continue and was instead showcased as an idle train game. 

The code included in this depository manages necessary in-game transactions, gives purchased items to players and loads assets when a player joins. 
After filtering enabled was introduced, the code was updated to work with the server-client boundary. Some code won't work due to further Roblox updates over the years and should only be used as reference.
